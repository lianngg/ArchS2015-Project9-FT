Fall-2013-CMUSDS
================

Rewrite the current Ruby on Rails web app on Heroku (http://cmu-sds.herokuapp.com/) into Java Play framework, aligning with the current APIs, to handle metadata view/creation/deletion of our Sensor Data Service Platform. Also, this platform will allow users to report bugs and have a detailed view of active VS nonactive sensors. This platform makes use of the Sensor Service Platform API, a REST API for interacting with the platform.
